# web-scraping
This is a python website scraping project.
We need to import selenium and beautiful soup 4 packages into the code. 
We use webdriver as chromedriver to get the URL link opened by it. 
A for loop is requires to iterate through the page numbers from 1 to 27.
We collect the data in from each page and store it in products[] and prices[] arrays.
We send the data into a csv file named products.csv and store it in columns the data provided by the website.
